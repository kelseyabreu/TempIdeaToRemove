## üîç The Problem

### Ecosystem Simulations Aren't Real Evolution

- Current evolution games treat evolution as simple upgrade paths
- Real ecosystem interactions are oversimplified in games
- Most games focus on individual creatures instead of entire ecosystems
- Mobile devices now have the computational power for true ecological simulation

### The Data:
- **2021:** Mobile game market reached $93.2 billion ([Newzoo, 2022](https://www.inverse.com/input/gaming/mobile-game-market-is-outpacing-pc-console-sales-combined))
- **2022:** Educational games market valued at $11.9 billion ([Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/game-based-learning-market-report))
- **2023:** 48% of gamers are interested in educational content ([ESA Gaming Report](https://www.theesa.com/resources/essential-facts-about-the-us-video-game-industry/2023-2/))
- **2024:** Mobile processors like A17/Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 offer 40% more computational power than 2021 chips ([Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/snapdragon-8-gen-3-benchmarks-3379534/))

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Step 1: Hierarchical Simulation Engine
Real-time ecological interactions with multi-level processing from individual behavior to evolutionary time

### Step 2: True Evolution Mechanics
Species evolve based on actual environmental pressures, not pre-programmed paths

### Step 3: Player Agency System
Users can manipulate environments, add/remove species, and create challenges without directly controlling organisms
